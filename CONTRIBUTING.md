### Getting Started ###
Julia Studio is open source software developed by Forio Online Simulations and licensed under GPL v3. As a consequence, we need all contributers to [sign this](forio.com/julia/fca.html)

Now that's out of the way, let's make Julia Studio better! There are many things to be done:
- You can fork Julia Studio from [http://github.com/forio/julia-studio], make cool things happen, and submit pull requests so that everyone else can make cool things too.
- Whenever you find yourself frustrated you can blow off some steam by raising the issue [here](https://github.com/forio/julia-studio/issues).
- You can make a big difference by helping people who've themselves raised issues.
